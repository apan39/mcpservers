## Project Structure
This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers project with deployment automation, part of the apan39 Coolify ecosystem.

## Coolify Deployment Protocol

**MANDATORY: Read this before any Coolify operations**

### 1. Pre-deployment Checks
- Read COOLIFY_API_DEBUGGING.md for comprehensive debugging patterns
- Verify environment variables are set correctly in .env file
- Use MCP Coolify tools to check server status: `coolify-get-version`
- Confirm target application UUID and current status

### 2. Deployment Process
```bash
# 1. Trigger deployment via API (ensure correct authentication)
source .env
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${COOLIFY_API_TOKEN}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"uuid": "APPLICATION_UUID"}' \
  "http://135.181.149.150:8000/api/v1/deploy"

# 2. Capture deployment UUID from response
# 3. Monitor deployment progress with logs
```

### 3. Deployment Verification Protocol
**Always perform these checks after deployment:**
- [ ] Deployment API returns success status  
- [ ] Deployment logs show container start without errors
- [ ] Application responds to HTTP health check
- [ ] MCP endpoint responds correctly
- [ ] Environment variables are properly loaded

### 4. Error Investigation Protocol  
**Follow this exact sequence for failures:**
1. **Use MCP Coolify tools first** (coolify-list-applications, etc.)
2. **Check deployment logs** via API with deployment UUID:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${COOLIFY_API_TOKEN}" \
     "http://135.181.149.150:8000/api/v1/deployments/DEPLOYMENT_UUID"
   ```
3. **Verify application configuration** (build pack, env vars, dockerfile)
4. **Common issues**: 
   - Missing MCP_API_KEY environment variable
   - Health check failures (`curl: not found` - add curl to Dockerfile)
   - Wrong CMD in Dockerfile
   - Missing dependencies in requirements.txt
5. **Test basic connectivity** before assuming application issues

### 5. Known Working Applications

**API Compliance:** All tools now conform to official Coolify API specification

### 6.1 SSE Deployment Monitoring Usage

**üöÄ How to Use Real-time Deployment Monitoring:**

1. **Start Deployment with Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Use the new SSE-enabled deployment tool instead of regular deploy
   coolify-deploy-with-sse-monitoring --app_uuid YOUR_APP_UUID --force true
   ```

2. **Monitor Real-time Progress:**
   ```bash
   # Check current status (includes deployment UUID)
   coolify-get-sse-deployment-status --deployment_uuid DEPLOYMENT_UUID
   
   # List all active deployments being monitored
   coolify-list-active-sse-deployments
   ```

3. **Stream Live Updates (Optional):**
   ```bash
   # Connect to SSE stream for real-time events
   curl -N -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     "http://localhost:3009/sse/deployment/DEPLOYMENT_UUID"
   ```

4. **Benefits Over Traditional Deployment:**
   - ‚úÖ **No Command Overlap** - Know exactly when deployment finishes
   - ‚úÖ **Real-time Status** - Live progress updates every 5 seconds
   - ‚úÖ **Automatic Completion Detection** - Stops monitoring when done
   - ‚úÖ **Background Monitoring** - Non-blocking, continues in background
   - ‚úÖ **SSE Stream Available** - For real-time dashboard integration

5. **Example Client:** See `python/examples/sse_deployment_client.py` for complete usage example

### 7. Communication Guidelines
- **Use SSE deployment monitoring** to eliminate command overlap issues
- **Never assume deployment success** without explicit verification
- **Always check logs** when deployments fail
- **Use systematic debugging** approach from COOLIFY_API_DEBUGGING.md
- **Update status** in this document after major changes

### 8. Code Development Protocol
**MANDATORY: Follow this sequence when implementing new features**

1. **Code Implementation**
   - Implement new features locally
   - Test TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`
   - Verify syntax and imports are correct

2. **Git Operations (CRITICAL)**
   - **ALWAYS commit code changes to git first**
   - **ALWAYS push commits to remote repository**
   - **NEVER attempt to test deployed features without committed code**
   - Coolify deploys from the git repository, not local files

3. **Deployment & Testing**
   - Deploy application via Coolify API
   - Wait for deployment to complete successfully
   - Then test new MCP tools on remote server
   - Verify tools are available and functioning

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Remote MCP servers pull code from git repository. Local changes that aren't committed and pushed will NOT be deployed.
