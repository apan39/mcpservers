## Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Generate a secure API key
openssl rand -hex 32

# Edit .env with your secure credentials
# Required: MCP_API_KEY=<your-generated-secure-token>
# Optional: COOLIFY_BASE_URL, COOLIFY_API_TOKEN (for Coolify integration)
```

### 2. Docker Deployment (Recommended)

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up --build

# Test health endpoints
curl http://localhost:3009/health
curl http://localhost:3010/health

# Test with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/list", "id": 1}' \
     http://localhost:3009/mcp
```

### 3. Claude MCP Integration

## 🏗️ Architecture - Modular Coolify Tools

The Coolify integration has been refactored into a **modular package architecture** for better maintainability:

### Package Structure:
```
coolify_tools/
├── __init__.py          # Package exports  
├── base.py              # Common utilities (auth, headers, base URL)
├── core.py              # Core tools (4 tools: version, projects, servers, deployment info)
├── applications.py      # Application management (18 tools: lifecycle, config, health)
├── databases.py         # Database management (7 tools: CRUD operations for all DB types)
├── services.py          # Service management (8 tools: Docker services lifecycle)
├── deployments.py       # Deployment monitoring (4 tools: logs, metrics, watch)
├── environments.py      # Environment variables (3 tools: set, delete, bulk update)
└── registry.py          # Central tool registration
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Maintainable** - Single responsibility per module
- ✅ **Testable** - Isolated functionality is easier to test
